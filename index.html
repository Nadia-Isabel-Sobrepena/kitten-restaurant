                    <h2>A Vision Born From<br><em>Absolute Stillness.</em></h2>

                    <div class="founder-body">
                        <p>Monsieur Flocon conceived the idea for Félin & Fourchette in the autumn of 2017, during an extended period of seated contemplation on the windowsill of a fourth-floor apartment in the 6th arrondissement. By all accounts, he did not move for eleven hours. What emerged from that silence was, according to those present, a fully formed gastronomic philosophy — communicated, as was his custom, entirely through sustained eye contact and a single, deliberate blink.</p>

                        <p>He scouted the original location on Rue du Cherche-Midi himself, identifying the property after walking its perimeter three times and sitting in the doorway for forty minutes before anyone could stop him. Contractors who worked on the renovation have described his oversight as "relentless" and "occasionally alarming." He attended every design meeting. He left two of them early, without explanation, and was later found on the roof.</p>

                        <p>Since opening in 2019, Monsieur Flocon has served as Chairman of the restaurant, attending service each evening from his designated position atop the host stand. He does not greet guests. He assesses them. Those who have earned his acknowledgement — a slow turn of the head, held for approximately three seconds — describe it as one of the more meaningful experiences of their dining lives.</p>

                        <blockquote class="founder-quote">
                            "He has never once been late. He has, however, occasionally chosen not to come downstairs, and on those evenings, the entire kitchen works differently. More carefully..."
                            <cite>— Chef de Cuisine, Hélène Voss</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Monsieur Flocon does not give interviews. He has been offered several book deals, all of which he ignored with what his literary agent described as "a masterful command of silence." He remains, by every measure, the most influential figure in contemporary Parisian dining.</p>

                    <h2>Temperament Is an Ingredient.</h2>

                <div class="philosophy-body">
                    <p>At Félin & Fourchette, we operate on a straightforward premise: the psychological disposition of a dish is as integral to its composition as the ingredients themselves. This is not a gimmick. It is the result of fifteen years of longitudinal research into feline behavioral profiles and their natural expression through classical cooking technique.</p>
                    <p>Our kitchen is staffed by a rotating selection of cats, each rigorously assessed upon onboarding for emotional range, stress response, and interpersonal availability. These profiles directly inform the menu. A dish developed in collaboration with a stoic, avoidant subject will ferment longer, rest in silence, and resist sweetness. A chaotic, treat-motivated contributor produces work that is loud, immediate, and structurally unpredictable.</p>
                    <p>We do not anthropomorphize. We document, measure, and plate accordingly. Every item on our menu carries a behavioral notation reviewed quarterly by our in-house animal behaviorist, Dr. Sylvie Marchand, in partnership with our executive chef. The result is a dining experience that is, above all, honest.</p>
