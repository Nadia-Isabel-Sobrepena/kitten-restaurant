# Félin & Fourchette 

A fake fine dining restaurant website where the entire culinary team is cats. Built as a fun side project.

The concept: a Michelin-starred Parisian restaurant that treats feline temperament as a legitimate culinary methodology. The founder is a cat. The menu items have personality disorders. The philosophy section is written completely straight-faced.

## What's in here

- `index.html` — the full site structure
- `style.css` — all styling (Cormorant Garamond + DM Sans, linen tones)
- `script.js` — menu data and filtering logic

## Features

- Filterable menu by course (Bread & Pastry, Starters, Mains, Dessert & Café)
- Founder section for Monsieur Flocon, Chairman
- Philosophy section with behavioral sourcing pillars
- Tasting menu callout
- Fully responsive

## Stack

Just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. No frameworks, no build tools. Open `index.html` in a browser and it works.

## Notes

This is a side project / design exercise. The cat pictures are sourced from Pinterest. The descriptions are written in the style of a restaurant that has never once acknowledged that its staff are, in fact, cats.
